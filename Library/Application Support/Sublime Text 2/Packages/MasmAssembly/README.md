MasmAssembly
===============

A Sublime Text 3 plugin providing syntax highlighting for x86/x86-64 assembly code in MASM/JWASM style.

This plugin implies a limited set of x86 ISA and most of MASM keywords. While it should be enough for the most of people, you are more than welcome to create an issue.
